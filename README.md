Faustine allows the edition of Faust (http://faust.grame.fr) code. 

## Features

- Project-based (inter-linked Faust files)
- Faust code syntax hightlighting, indentation and keyword completion
- Build/compile with output window
- Graphic diagrams generation and vizualisation in the (default) browser
- Browse generated C++ code inside Emacs
- Inter-linked files/buffers :
    - From "component" to Faust file
    - From "include" to Faust library file
- From error to file:line number
- From function name to online documentation
- Fully configurable (build type/target/architecture/toolkit, keyboard shortcuts, etc.)
- Automatic keyword completion 
- Modeline indicator of the state of the code

## Installation

### Easy

- Install it from [MELPA](https://melpa.org).

### Hard

- Copy/clone this repository in `load-path`
- Add
```
(require `faustine)
```
to your init file

### Faust
Oh, and of course install [the latest Faust](http://faust.grame.fr/download/) and ensure it`s in the PATH.

## Usage

### Enter the mode

Use `faustine-mode` ; Optionally, add something like this to your init file:
```
(add-to-list `auto-mode-alist
             '("\\.dsp\\'" . faustine-mode))
```
to put any new Faust file in the mode.

### Commands
Every interactive command is documented in [the README](https://bitbucket.org/yassinphilip/faustine/src/master/README.md?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default) file.

## faustine-mode
A mode to allow the edition of Faust code.

Syntax highlighting of all the Faust commands and operators, as
well as indentation rules.

Every referenced ("component") file is linked, and can be
opened by clicking on it or by pressing `RET` over it ; Imported
library files are linked too.

The code is checked at each save ; The state of the last check is
displayed in the modeline as a green bug icon when it compiles
without error or warning, and a red bug when it doesn't. This
icon is also the main Faustine menu.

An "output buffer" is provided to display information about the
Faust command output, you can toggle its visibility with
`faustine-toggle-output-buffer` ; see `faustine-output-mode`
documentation for details about interaction in said buffer.

Several commands allow the editing of Faust code, they are all
available in the menu or as a key binding, and described below.

When interactively called with prefix, indent the enclosing defun
instead.

## faustine-output-mode
The Faust output buffer mode. 
The output buffer displays the result of the commands with their time stamps and status. 

- A click on an error opens the buffer at the error line
- A click on an executable name runs it.

Available key bindings in the output buffer:

### faustine-output-mode Keys

Key  | Binding 
------------- | ------------- 
`q` | [delete-window](#markdown-header-delete-window)

### faustine-output-mode Commands
#### delete-window
> Defined in *window.el*


It is bound to C-x 0.

(delete-window &optional WINDOW)

Delete WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.
Return nil.

If the variable `ignore-window-parameters` is non-nil or the
`delete-window` parameter of WINDOW equals t, do not process any
parameters of WINDOW.  Otherwise, if the `delete-window`
parameter of WINDOW specifies a function, call that function with
WINDOW as its sole argument and return the value returned by that
function.

Otherwise, if WINDOW is part of an atomic window, call
`delete-window` with the root of the atomic window as its
argument.  Signal an error if WINDOW is either the only window on
its frame, the last non-side window, or part of an atomic window
that is its frame's root window.
