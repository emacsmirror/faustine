Edit, visualize, build and run Faust code.
Inspired by Faustworks, now deprecated.

### Features

- Project-based (inter-linked Faust files)
- Faust code syntax hightlighting, indentation and keyword completion
- Build/compile with configurable output window
- Graphic diagrams generation and vizualisation in the browser
- Browse generated C++ code inside Emacs
- Inter-linked files/buffers :
- From "component" to Faust file
- From "include" to library file
- From error to file, direct to line number
- From function name to online documentation
- Fully configurable (build type/target/architecture/toolkit, keyboard shortcuts, etc.)
- Automatic keyword completion
- Modeline indicator of the state of the code

### Installation

- Clone this repo in your PATH
- Require the file in your init file:

        (require 'faustine)

### Usage

- Just open a .dsp file/project (use `faustine-configure` to set your own Faust file extension)
- Look at the modeline, in the bottom of the buffer: The bug is green when your Faust code compiles without errors, and red otherwise. This icon is also a menu where you can access Faustine's main functions and commands.
- Use `faustine-toggle-output-buffer` to view the Faust build output
- Use `faustine-diagram` to view the diagram of the current Faust file
- Use `faustine-diagram-all` to view the diagrams of the linked (component) Faust files
- Use `faustine-build` to build the executable of the current Faust file
- Use `faustine-build-all` to build the executables of the linked (component) Faust files
- Use `faustine-source-code` to view the C++ code of the current Faust file
- Use `faustine-mdoc` to view the Mdoc (PDF) of the current Faust file
- Select a Faust function, and use `C-c C-h` to view its definition/docstring
- Use `faustine-configure` to set your options/preferences
- Use `C-h m` for help and commands

### Notes

Usage of Faustine with a completion backend system
like Auto-Complete or Company is highly recommended.
